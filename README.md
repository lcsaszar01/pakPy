# pakPy

This project is part of the FORZA subproject of [Dr. Kogge's Computer Lab](https://cse.nd.edu/faculty/peter-kogge/) in the [University of Notre Dame Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.nd.edu)

Inspired by the original work of Dr. P Ghosh et al. in the PaKman: A Scalable Algorithm for Generating Genomic Contigs on Distributed Memory Machines ([github](https://github.com/pnnl/pakman)). This project works to speed up the outcomes seen in the paper.
